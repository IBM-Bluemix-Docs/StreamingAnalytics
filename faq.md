## What tasks am I responsible for?  
{: #responsible notoc}
{: faq}

You write the applications that run in a {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service and Streams instance on-prem and ensure that they are functioning correctly and meeting performance requirements. You are also responsible for any application-specific monitoring.

## Is high availability (HA) supported?
{: #ha notoc}
{: faq}

High availability is managed by IBM. {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} is configured to support HA. More server resources are in place in the event of a failover.

## How is security managed for the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service?

The service is created and fully managed by IBM. Each service consists of a dedicated set of application resources.

## How do I develop Streams applications?
{: #streamsapp notoc}
{: faq}

You must develop Streams applications locally by using the free Streams [{{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} Quick Start Edition with Docker ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.documentation/docs/4.3/qse-install-docker/).

You can also use the on-premises {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} installation if you have one. Applications that you develop and compile locally can then be seamlessly deployed as a bundle to a Streams service in the cloud.

But if you want to run your Python applications in the cloud, you donâ€™t need to install {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} on-premises. Simply use the `STREAMING\_ANALYTICS\_SERVICE` context to submit your Python applications to the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service. You can develop the applications in a standard Python development environment or in a Jupyter interactive notebook, but you must use Python 3.5.

For more information on developing applications, see the [{{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} Development Guide](/docs/StreamingAnalytics?topic=StreamingAnalytics-development_guide).

## Can I sign in to a {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service host directly?
{: #host notoc}  
{: faq}

No. A direct login to the server with Telnet or a Secure Shell (ssh) is not supported. You cannot install additional software or run non-Streams software on a Streams host.

## Can I access the file system on the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service?
{: #filesystem notoc}
{: faq}   

Only your Streams applications can directly access the file system on a Streams host.

Cloud-ready alternatives exist for solutions that need a mechanism for Streams to interact with other solution components. You can use other source and sink protocols instead of files. For example, cloud-based data stores.

## How can the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service applications access my organization's enterprise data?
{: #access notoc}  

You can use the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Secure Gateway Service](https://{DomainName}/catalog/services/secure-gateway) to securely connect streams applications to your enterprise.

## Are all the features for IBM Streams for on premises supported by the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service in the cloud?
{: #features notoc}

Some of the features that are not supported for {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service include:

  - Administrative tasks for an instance that require domain authority. For example, adding custom host tags or creating a job group.
  - Some of the toolkit operators are not supported. For more information, see [Supported toolkits and adapters](/docs/StreamingAnalytics?topic=StreamingAnalytics-compatible_toolkits).
  - The Streams JMX API.
