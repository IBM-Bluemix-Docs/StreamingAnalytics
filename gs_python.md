# Streams Python apps for Streaming Analytics
{: #gettingstarted_py}

You can now create Streams apps in a Python environment such as {{site.data.keyword.DSX_full}}, and submit these apps to the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} instance to be deployed in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. You no longer need to install {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} locally to compile and deploy a Streams Python app.

Get started by creating sample Streams Python apps using Jupyter notebooks in {{site.data.keyword.DSX_short}}, and submit these apps to the service instance directly from {{site.data.keyword.DSX_short}}. For more information, see [Developing Streams Python apps in {{site.data.keyword.DSX_short}}](/docs/services/StreamingAnalytics/t_develop_apps_python.html#t_develop_python_dsx).

{{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} also supports the deployment of Streams apps from your local Python environment. You must use the [{{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} Python Application API ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.documentation/docs/python/python-appapi-devguide/#50-api-features), which is included in the streamsx package, to develop your Streams Python apps locally and submit them to the service instance. To get started, follow the steps in the [Developing for the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.documentation/docs/python/1.6/python-appapi-devguide-2a/index.html) tutorial.
